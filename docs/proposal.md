- The user creates a Collection's <em>Presentation Window</em> using form fields to enter details about the Collection as well as uploading an "ID" icon connected to a <em>Collectible item</em>.  This <em>Presentation Window</em> will show up as a <em>Modal Window</em> in the browser after the Collectible ID image icon is clicked.

### Frontend vs. Background activity
If there is any actions your app needs to take in the background describe _each_ of them and how they change the underlying data your app saves.

- Home Page ['Create a Collection'](#samp1) button when clicked
  1. open a prompt to ask the user to name the new Collection
  2. backend creates a new HTML file and names it the same (from given "blank" HTML template with pre-made <form> nodes)

- Starting off Building a Collection [<em>form/Presentation Window</em>](#samp2),
  1. as the form is being built, HTML input nodes are being appended to the form). ****Maybe Pre-built form will be better to start with.
  2. The <em>Save Layout</em> button saves the Collection's HTML file.

- [Add to Collection button](#samp2) takes the Collectible's form data and stores it as an key/value pair in an array/list.  The picture ID icon is stored in an image folder.

- Share/Embed buttons code copied to clipboard and

What do they represent?

  stamps, DVDs, music,)
- [collectible (item)](#samp4) ---------> A single item in a Collection
- User Accounts
- uploaded media for collections, collectibles, account profile image
- form data pertinent to collections, collectibles, user profile


### Category
- name (allows for user to make sub-categories expanding on "type" in Collection model

### Collection
- owner (Foreign Key)
- image (user upload)
- name of Collection (e.g. My Paintings from the 70's)
- type of Collection (e.g. visual art - oil on canvas)
- categories (Many to many relationship) (e.g. Jazz, classical)
- created (date)
- status (private or public)

### Collectible/Item
- photo ID/cover art (user upload)
- name
- description
- Author/Composer or Creator
- Artist
- Publisher
- Year Published
- Copyright year
- serial number
- classification (Many to Many Relationship)
- date created
- date last saved

### Link
- name
- link

### Technical Components

- form submission using Django built-ins
- image uploads using Django helper functions and Media storage
- jQuery to provide modal windows for Collectibles
- jQuery to allow for Hide/Show for collectible UI
- Bootstrap to help with form presentation and overall website base appearance.


### Schedule

1. Write Django Classes
2. Write basic view functions
3. Establish base template style and look
4. work on Collection form (view and template)
5. work on Collectible form (view and template)
6. implement jQuery modal window and style window for collection view when clicking on a Collectible
7. establish accounts app for user registration, log-in and profiles
8. continually adjust CSS to make site uniform and understandable
9. Add edit ability to collectibles and collections
10. Add Django Formset to Collectible form to enable web links and downloads for a Collectible
11. test out multiple user accounts with multiple collections
12. work on website click routing to make sure those without an account get directed to Reg. page or those logged-out get routed to a Log-in.  After log-in route to collection gallery, etc.
13. customize Nav bar with conditional statements in template to help out routing and signal when someone is signed in
14. Add embed feature by providing a link accessed through jQuery.  (** Need to deploy to test out this feature on other sites.)


### Further Work

- Add dropdown on Collection form for sub-categories of collections with specific fields relevant to common collectibles (books, instruments, stamps, comics, etc.).  This can help remove irrelevant fields and blank fields.

- Make Gallery pictures uniform through a module to auto-size pics in Collection gallery but not alter or distort picture that shows in Collectible view

- Fix EDIT-ADD to only work for a User's collectibles not with another user's collectibles (i.e. I shouldn't be able to edit someone else's collectible)

- Add + symbol to Categories when creating a New Collection to create Categories on-the-fly (?????)

- Add placeholders to Link Model for URL fields (started this)

- Get Profile update and password reset to work

- Make Contact page post (send via email)

- Drag and Drop with Sortable to allow user to shift collections and collectibles around in the Gallery (http://rubaxa.githwub.io/Sortable/)

- Make Modal Window have a photo carousel for extra photos (or thumbnails)

- Add ability to add audio, video players, slideshows
    - Consider ability to upload audio and show as HTML5 audio player

- Add API to use computer's camera to take User Registration profile pic

- Incorporate search engine (search field on template to locate all Collections about 'cats' or 'musical instruments')
