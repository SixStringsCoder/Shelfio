- The user creates a Collection's <em>Presentation Window</em> using form fields to enter details about the Collection as well as uploading an "ID" icon connected to a <em>Collectible item</em>.  This <em>Presentation Window</em> will show up as a <em>Modal Window</em> in the browser after the Collectible ID image icon is clicked.

- <strong>Each Collectible</strong> is represented by a picture ID icon (uploaded by the user) and this icon, inserted in a <em>Styled Background</em> Collection area (see sample picture 6 - e.g. a bookshelf for a book collection, a stamp book for stamp collection, etc.) will act as the link to open the Modal Presentation Window revealing the Collectible's details entered in the form.

<strong><a name="samp4">A sample template using an example of an eBook collection.  After filling out the form and attaching links to the buttons and docs/images, the user clicks "Add to Collection."

### Frontend vs. Background activity
If there is any actions your app needs to take in the background describe _each_ of them and how they change the underlying data your app saves.

- Home Page ['Create a Collection'](#samp1) button when clicked
  1. open a prompt to ask the user to name the new Collection
  2. backend creates a new HTML file and names it the same (from given "blank" HTML template with pre-made <form> nodes)

- Starting off Building a Collection [<em>form/Presentation Window</em>](#samp2),
  1. as the form is being built, HTML input nodes are being appended to the form). ****Maybe Pre-built form will be better to start with.
  2. The <em>Save Layout</em> button saves the Collection's HTML file.

- [Add to Collection button](#samp2) takes the Collectible's form data and stores it as an key/value pair in an array/list.  The picture ID icon is stored in an image folder.

- Share/Embed buttons code copied to clipboard and



### MVP
**Pick the minimum feature set for your product to work.**
Everything else should go in the "further work" section.

##### Models
- 2 table database (Collection and Collectible) ForeignKey

##### Templates
- [Home HTML](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/the-big-picture/)
- [Collectible Form HTML (Editing Presentation Window)](#samp5)
- [Single Collection HTML (with Presentation Modal Window)](#samp6)
- [All Collections HTML](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/thumbnail-gallery/)


Write out a description of _every_ page and component and action!!!!!!


### Data Model

What are the persistent "nouns" you need to save across pages in your project MVP?
What do they represent?

- [Collection](#samp6) ------> Collection Sets (e.g. books,
  stamps, DVDs, music,)
- [collectible (item)](#samp4) ---------> A single item in a Collection


How do you need to _search_ for specific instances of nouns?

### Category
- name (allows for user to make sub-categories expanding on "type" in Collection model

### Collection
- owner (Foreign Key)
- image (user upload)
- name of Collection (e.g. My Paintings from the 70's)
- type of Collection (e.g. visual art - oil on canvas)
- categories (Many to many relationship) (e.g. Jazz, classical)
- created (date)
- status (private or public)

### Collectible/Item
- photo ID/cover art (user upload)
- name
- description
- Author/Composer or Creator
- Artist
- Publisher
- Year Published
- Copyright year
- serial number
- classification (Many to Many Relationship)
- date created
- date last saved

### Link
- name
- link
- collectible (Foreign Key)



### Technical Components
What are the "moving parts" of your MVP?
What are the things like "modules" you're going to write?
How do they talk to each other?





_Make decisions_ here and now.
Do research and prototyping to figure out what libraries and technologies will help you solve your problems.
Write up which ones you'll use.
It's okay if they end up not working and you have to change your plans.

- WSIWYG editor plug-in for user to customize Presentation Window and Collection's Display View

- jQuery UI (use "draggable" and "droppable" interactions https://jqueryui.com/droppable/) for drag and drop feature to make <a name="samp2">form/Presentation Window</a>.  
Also this plug-in for drag and drop jQuery form maker: https://formbuilder.online/

- Bootstrap to help with form presentation and overall website appearance.


### Schedule

Write out the order in which you will tackle your technical components of your MVP.

What are the easy parts?
What are the hard parts?
Can you guess how long you'll take for each?

Work on the tough and crucial parts first.

### Further Work

All of the above parts are _just addressing your MVP_.
Here you should outline other features you'd like to implement if you get "done" early.
Order them by importance towards your high-level goal and what order you'll work on them later.

Don't work on any of these features until **all of MVP is complete**.

## Submission

Create a _new_ git repo based on your project name [in GitHub](https://github.com/new).
Init that repository with a readme.
Write up your proposal as `proposal.md` and link to it from the readme.
I don't care that you learn all of the fancy parts of [writing Markdown documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/), but just get some basic sections that follow the rubric above.

Email me the URL to your capstone repo on GitHub before the proposal is due.
