Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size.

One common question is whether a cutaway diminishes the tonal output of an acoustic guitar in a significant way. The truth is not by much, because that particular portion of the soundboard doesn't drive a lot of the tonal output. The taper of a guitar's waist will actually have more of an impact on tone.

This model extends the classical systemic model by introducing and expanding on the 'mental' dimension of mental-somatic models. The central point of their work is the thesis that addicts themselves have to reorganize and restructure their own habitual ways of perception and cognition. Vipassana meditation serves as the instrument of choice to realize this transformation. Vipassana comprises an ethical lifestyle (moral conduct), concentration of the mind through meditation, and working progressively on one's own mental-somatic models.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis essay is directed towards practitioners within the fields of drug addiction, psychotherapy, social work, life counseling and coaching who are interested in the development of the autonomy of their clients and their own autonomy.

His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian.[3] At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens[4] and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects \u2013 including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government \u2013 and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC.[5]\r\n\r\nTeaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies. He established a library in the Lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books, which were written on papyrus scrolls.[6] The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of Platonism, but, following Plato's death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism.[7] He believed all peoples' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception. Aristotle's views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works.", "creator": "n/a", "artist": null, "publisher": null, "pubyear": null, "copyright": null, "identifier": null, "created": "2017-07-11T22:40:56.024Z", "modified": "2017-07-11T22:40:35.473Z", "slug": "aristotle", "classification": []}}, {"model": "collection.collectible", "pk": 25, "fields": {"collection": 8, "image": "nathaniel/Aestheticians/John_Cage.jpg", "name": "John Cage", "description": "Cage is perhaps best known for his 1952 composition 4\u203233\u2033, which is performed in the absence of deliberate sound; musicians who present the work do nothing aside from being present for the duration specified by the title.
